Title: The Devember challenge

Authors: Tim Liou

I, Tim Liou, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be
programming a part of Wastale, a game project. I promise I will program for my
Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write
a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the
internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

The content above is the contract of [Devember](http://devember.org/), a really
interesting challenge in December.

# Detail

Wastale is a developing game inspired by
[Handmade Hero](http://handmadehero.org/). This game will focus on big, various
enemies and different kinds of weapons. I hope this game can give players
hunting excitement but not in mission-based. There are still lots of game design
decisions need to make. Obviously, I don't have to worry about them now. In
December, I will first build up the minimum windows platform layer just like
Handmade Hero did. Then, I will implement some basic stuff for a platformer
game.

# Goals

Therefore, following are my Devember goals.

* Basic Windows platform layer
* World/Map handling
* Entity handling

# DJ! Play the music

I really love the idea of Devember. Let's start the party.
