project &lt;a href="http://handmadehero.org/"&gt;Handmade Hero&lt;/a&gt; last year. I still remember
how excited I was when I watched the very first episode of Handmade Hero. After
following 70 episodes, I start thinking what I could use from what I learned. I
am not saying I will stop following this project or I have leaned enough from
it. I just mean that I am the kind of person can learn more by doing. Therefore,
I decide to make my own game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a college student right now. Basically, I can say this period of time is the
most free time in my whole life. I can learn whatever I want and do whatever I
want. One reason why I choose computer science as my college major is my passion
for indie games. Indie games truly rock my soul. I saw something very unique in
them. Unlike AAA games, I can feel real "connect" between players and game
designers. That definitely is what I want to do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What genre will this game be?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love puzzle games like &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/"&gt;Braid&lt;/a&gt; and
roguelike games like
&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/"&gt;The Binding of Isaac&lt;/a&gt;. As my first
game, this game might be a 2D roguelike game. When I was a junior high school
student, I really enjoyed the excitement of fighting huge enemies in Monster
Hunter but sucked at the feature of collecting materials for forging weapons. In
this game, I will get rid of the concept of collecting and focus on the weapon
system and huge enemies. I will talk about them in the later posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish this game before I graduate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship on Windows and Linux at least since I only have machines with these
  operation systems now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Keep going on&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions speak louder than words. Procrastination is the horrible enemy. I will
post something new about Wastale at least every two weeks. You have my word.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
