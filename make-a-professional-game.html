    <p><a href="http://mollyrocket.com/casey/about.html">Casey Muratori</a> launched a brilliant
project <a href="http://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a> last year. I still remember
how excited I was when I watched the very first episode of Handmade Hero. After
following 70 episodes, I start thinking what I could use from what I learned. I
am not saying I will stop following this project or I have leaned enough from
it. I just mean that I am the kind of person can learn more by doing. Therefore,
I decide to make my own game.</p>
<h1>Why now?</h1>
<p>I am a college student right now. Basically, I can say this period of time is the
most free time in my whole life. I can learn whatever I want and do whatever I
want. One reason why I choose computer science as my college major is my passion
for indie games. Indie games truly rock my soul. I saw something very unique in
them. Unlike AAA games, I can feel real "connect" between players and game
designers. That definitely is what I want to do in the future.</p>
<h1>What genre will this game be?</h1>
<p>I love puzzle games like <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/">Braid</a> and
roguelike games like
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/">The Binding of Isaac</a>. As my first
game, this game might be a 2D roguelike game. When I was a junior high school
student, I really enjoyed the excitement of fighting huge enemies in Monster
Hunter but sucked at the feature of collecting materials for forging weapons. In
this game, I will get rid of the concept of collecting and focus on the weapon
system and huge enemies. I will talk about them in the later posts.</p>
<h1>Goal</h1>
<ul>
<li>Finish this game before I graduate.</li>
<li>Ship on Windows and Linux at least since I only have machines with these
  operation systems now.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Keep going on</h1>
<p>Actions speak louder than words. Procrastination is the horrible enemy. I will
post something new about Wastale at least every two weeks. You have my word.</p>
