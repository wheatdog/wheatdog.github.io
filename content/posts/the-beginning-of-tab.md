# Introduction

Hi, this is Venses Tab. When I was in junior high school, I started listening
electronic music. At that time, I quite enjoyed the music taking me floating
above mind sea. My mp3 was used to load lots of industrial-loud electronic noise,
you should wonder that why a boy had this strange passion on such noise in his
early life. You know what, because the beats are truly epic! Until now, I still
love plugging earphone, wandering in digital labyrinth.

# Play around

In the beginning of my college's life, I ask myself, "How about I compose my own
music?". Thanks to the prosperity of clubs in my college, there is a club
teaching me composing digital music using
[Ableton Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton-Live), and also I learn
some DJ skills. When time goes on, the laziness of attitude and loads of
assignment let me often get tired of practicing.

# Motivation

Luckily, Tim and I found Stringbulbs. We have lots of memories of thinking game
ideas when we were little. This time, in November, we launch a new project for
our first game. In this team, Tim is as programmer, and I am as soundtrack
producer, maybe sometimes help Tim program a little bit, ugh..., all I want to
say is I hope this work can motivate me to find my lost passion about music
composition.

# Goal?

Before 2015 ends, I promise I will finish a set for DJ performance and one
experimental music soundtrack. Also, in leisure time, I will post some my
opinion and thought about music and project here, hope you guys have a nice
day!
