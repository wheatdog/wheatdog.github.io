Title: Devember Day 2 - Live Code Editing
Date: 2015-12-02

Today's code is on
[this tag](https://github.com/wheatdog/wastale/tree/devember_2). The complete
code can be found in [here](https://github.com/wheatdog/wastale).

The most coolest thing I did today is "Live Code Editing" that Casey mentioned
in Handmade Hero week 5. The basic idea is to make platform independent code be
another translation unit, and compile it to a DLL. Then, we can dynamically load
it in the Win32 platform code. By doing so, we can change our game code without
reopening the executable file at some point.

I might implement the "Loop editing" feature after I got some entities on the
screen. Tomorrow, I will start doing some game code. Until then.
